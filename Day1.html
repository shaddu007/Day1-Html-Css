              Windows: It's like the ultimate multitasker for your computer
              life. From late-night study sessions to gaming marathons, it's got
              your back. With Windows, I can switch between assignments and
              Netflix faster than you can say 'coffee break.' It's the college
              buddy I didn't know I needed.

              Apple: The 'i' in Overpriced. While they make sleek gadgets,
              you'll pay a premium for the logo. It's like buying a designer
              hoodie for your tech life. So, if you're okay with splurging for a
              fancy fruit logo, Apple's got you covered. Just don't expect them
              to throw in the charger!.
